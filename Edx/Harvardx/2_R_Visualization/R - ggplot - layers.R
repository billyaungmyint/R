#In ggplot2, graphs are created by adding layers to the ggplot object:
#DATA %>% ggplot() + LAYER_1 + LAYER_2 + ... + LAYER_N

#The geometry layer defines the plot type and takes the format geom_X where X is the plot type.
#Aesthetic mappings describe how properties of the data connect with features of the graph (axis position, color, size, etc.) Define aesthetic mappings with the aes() function.
#You can add layers with different aesthetic mappings to the same graph.
