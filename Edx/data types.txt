Categorical data are variables that are defined by a small number of groups.
- Ordinal categorical data have an inherent order to the categories (mild/medium/hot, for example).
- Non-ordinal categorical data have no order to the categories.
Numerical data take a variety of numeric values.
- Continuous variables can take any value.
- Discrete variables are limited to sets of specific values.
