# Capstone Projects

Only the MovieLensProject and world-happiness folders are used. shot-logs.csv and kepler-labelled-time-series-data are early attempts at machine learning applications.


## Movie Recommendation System

Employs a regularized linear model to predict the ratings of movies in the MovieLens 10M data set. A machine learning algorithm could not be implemented due to the size of the data set. Script written in R, PDF/HTML report written in Rmd. Must unzip **movie_ratings_data.zip** in *ml-10M100K* folder to decompress data files. This has to be completed first in order for the script to run.


## Modeling National Happiness

Utilizes linear regression to predict happiness scores based on societal factors from the Gallup happiness ranking world poll. A theoretically perfect prediction system is tested alongside linear regression techniques from the `caret` package. Script written in R, PDF/HTML report written in Rmd. Only **2018.csv** and **2019.csv** data files are used in the script.
