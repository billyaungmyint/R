# HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate in R

Early assesments (courses 1-4) were mostly completed using Datacamp. Once productivity tools, like RStudio and GitHub were introduced in course 5, the scripts were completed in .R scripts.


### 1. R basics
- Basic R syntax, data types, vectors arithmetic, indexing, sorting, sorting using `dplyr`, and plotting using basic packages.

### 2. Visualization
- Data visualization principles, creating custom plots with `ggplot2`, and studying the advantages and pitfalls of widely-use plots.

### 3. Probability
- Probability theory concepts including the central limit theorem, random variables and independence, performing Monte Carlo simulations, and computing expected values and standard errors.

### 4. Inference & Modeling
- Defining parameters, estimates and standard errors, and margins of errors of populations in order to make predictions about data. Modeling aggregate data from different sources, Bayesian statistics and predictive modeling.

### 5. Productivity Tools
- Introduction of command line filing system, utilization of version control with git, and leveraging the powerful tools in RStudio.

### 6. Wrangling
- Importing data from different file formats, web scraping, tidy data with `tidyverse`, processing string with regex, wrangling data with `dplyr`, handling date and time formats in data, and text mining.

### 7. Linear Regression
- Developing linear regression mathematically, explaining and detecting confounding, implementing linear regression to understand the relationship between variables.

### 8. Machine Learning
- Machine learning basics, cross-validation to avoid overtraining, using popular machine learning algorithms from the `caret` package, employing regularization when appropriate.

### 9. Capstone
- Applying the skills learned throughout the series to a real-world problem through an independent data analysis project. See README file in 9-Capstone folder for project descriptions.
